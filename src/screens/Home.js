         <p>A good note-taking app should be fast. It should sync your notes across multiple devices quickly and accurately. It should be available no matter what computing platform you use now or might switch to in the future. It should have lightning-fast search across all of your notes. It shouldn’t be bogged down with too many confusing features — but it also can’t be so bare-bones that it won’t meet your needs. It should protect the security and privacy of your notes. It should also be inexpensive, or even free. </p>
